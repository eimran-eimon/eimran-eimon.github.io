title: "Classification Based Inter-Frame Prediction in Video Compression"

permalink: /publication/classification-based-video-coding
excerpt: '**Abstract**— Video compression is the technique of reducing
          the original size or storage of the video content. Traditional
          video coding uses the block-based translation motion model
          for this purpose. This approach often fails for preserving the
          good quality of compression, if the motion discontinuities exist
          in the video frames. A Block that contains the boundary of
          moving object need more bit for better prediction of the current
          frame. In the presence of complex motion model the traditional
          method catastrophically fails to predict the objects having the
          multiple motion. In this paper, we present a technique for the
          classification of blocks either it contains the single motion or
          multiple motion. Experimental result shows that the average
          accuracy for classification of HD sequences is 85.76% and the
          achieved bit rebate is up to 1.083% over standalone HEVC.'

**Abstract**— Video compression is the technique of reducing

classification of blocks either it contains the single motion or
multiple motion. Experimental result shows that the average
accuracy for classification of HD sequences is 85.76% and the
