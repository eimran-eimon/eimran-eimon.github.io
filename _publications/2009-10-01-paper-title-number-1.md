title: "Superpixel Based Inter-Frame Prediction for Video Coding"

permalink: /publication/superpixel-based-video-coding
excerpt: '**Abstract** —Traditional video codec uses the block-based approach 
          for motion estimation and compensation, which is unable
          to capture the true underlying motion. Blocks consisting the
          boundary of moving object need more bit for better prediction
          of the current frame because real-world objects are not block-based
          and their motion is not translational. One of the main goal
          of the current standard (HEVC) is to minimize the prediction
          error energy by using quad-tree splitting method. But if motion
          discontinuity exits, quad-tree based splitting method uses a large
          amount of motion bit-rate and also introduces a potential coding
          overhead in the video encoder and decoder. In this paper, we
          propose a segmentation-based method of using arbitrary shape
          superpixel and affine motion registration technique for reducing
          the prediction error energy between the current and reference
          frame. This method uses the already encoded reference frame
          for predicting the current frame. The experimental result shows
          that good subjective quality with PSNR up to 27.71dB can be
          obtained using this approach.'
