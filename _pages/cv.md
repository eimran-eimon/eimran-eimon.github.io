  As part of its digitalization process, the Bangladesh government has developed Government Resource Planning (GRP), an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution of its own, to manage works electronically to optimize and economize assets and expenses.
  GRP is consists of eleven modules. From which, I have worked on the “Accounts Module”. Accounts Module is designed to manage all kinds of financial activities records and transactions electronically to facilitate extensive search along with the generation of standard accounting reports.

    Project - People Counter: 
    The primary goal of this project is to find some useful business insight using the live CCTV feed
    of a store. Some main goals include:
    * Count the number of the person entered in and exited from the store.
    * Count the number of the person in a zone (like no. of people playing VR games).
    * Find the average time spent by a customer in a zone.
    * Generate a heatmap using a customer’s trajectories.
    * Store the age, gender, and emotion of a customer when they are in a specific zone(e.g. when they are seeing
    a new product or buying a product)
    
    I have used YOLOv3(You Only Look Once), MobilenetSSD(Single Shot Detection), Fast-RCNN for detecting
    people in real-time. And for tracking, I have used the “dlib correlation tracker”, which is based on Danelljan et al.’s
    2014 paper “Accurate Scale Estimation for Robust Visual Tracking”. I have also utilized the ”Intel OPENVINO”
    library for Age-Gender-Emotion detection.
    
    Result of my implemented models:    
     * Enter-exit count ([See Video Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CND1PB-FXwI56t-QMHTwWrBS2JkZB3fV/view?usp=sharing))
     * Age-gender-emotion detection ([See Video Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBAifjEJNkIMvB9441E-CiQxlowZpqXb/view))
